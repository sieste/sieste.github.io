<h1><a href=/ title="Stefan Siegert">Stefan Siegert</a></h1>

<p>I'm a Mathematics Lecturer in the Statistical Science group at the University of Exeter. I have a PhD in Physics from TU Dresden. See my <a href=/cv><b>professional CV</b></a> for more details.

<p>I try to be good at being a husband, father, scholar, athlete, artist &mdash;  to varying degrees of success. See my <a href=/now><b>now page</b></a> for what I'm up to at the moment.

<p>I was born in Germany in 1984. I now live in Exeter/Devon (UK) with my wife and three kids.



<h2>University</h2>

<p>
My students and I work on theory and application of spatiotemporal statistical models for forecasting. We develop mathematical methods that help us use observation data and computer simulations to understand the past and predict the future.

<p>
I have taught undergraduate and graduate courses 

<ul>
<li> Foundations (MTH1000)</li>
<li> Probability, Statistics, Data (MTH1004)</li>
<li> Statistical Inference (MTH3028)</li>
<li> Advanced Statistical Modelling (ECM3904)</li>
<li> Applications of Machine Learning and Statistics (MTHM503)</li>
</ul>

I have developed and delivered specialised workshops and courses on

<ul>
<li> Advanced Statistics Training for PhD students
<li> Met Office Statistics Training
<li> Introduction to Machine Learning and Neural Networks
</ul>




<h2>Projects</h2>

<ul>
<li><a href=https://github.com/sieste/nimrod>nimrod.R</a>: R functions to extract and visualise radar data from the NIMROD rain radar system
</ul>
