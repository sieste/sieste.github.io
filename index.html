<h1><a href=/ title="Stefan Siegert">Stefan Siegert</a></h1>

<p>I'm currently a Lecturer in Mathematics at the University of Exeter. I have a PhD in Physics from TU Dresden, followed by two post-docs in Statistics at Exeter.

<p>I try to be good at being a husband, father, scholar, athlete, artist &mdash; to varying degrees of success. See my <a href=/now><b>now page</b></a> for what I'm up to at the moment.

<p>I was born in Germany in 1984. I now live in Exeter/Devon (UK) with my wife and three kids.



<h2>University</h2>

<p>
My students and I work on theory and application of spatiotemporal statistical forecasting. We develop mathematical methods that help us use observation data and computer simulations to understand the past and predict the future. 

<p>
I have taught undergraduate and graduate mathematics courses at University of Exeter:

<ul>
<li> Foundations (MTH1000)</li>
<li> Probability, Statistics, Data (MTH1004)</li>
<li> Statistical Inference (MTH3028)</li>
<li> Advanced Statistical Modelling (ECM3904)</li>
<li> Applications of Machine Learning and Statistics (MTHM503)</li>
</ul>

I have developed and delivered specialised workshops and courses on

<ul>
<li> Advanced Statistics Training for PhD students
<li> Statistics and Machine Learning Training for Meteorologists
<li> Introduction to Machine Learning and Neural Networks
</ul>
