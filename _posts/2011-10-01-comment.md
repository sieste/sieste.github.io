**Abstract**

In a recent paper, Mason et al. propose a reliability test of ensemble
forecasts for a continuous, scalar verification. As noted in the paper, the
test relies on a very specific interpretation of ensembles, namely, that the
ensemble members represent quantiles of some underlying distribution. This
quantile interpretation is not the only interpretation of ensembles, another
popular one being the Monte Carlo interpretation. Mason et al. suggest
estimating the quantiles in this situation; however, this approach is
fundamentally flawed. Errors in the quantile estimates are not independent of
the exceedance events, and consequently the conditional exceedance
probabilities (CEP) curves are not constant, which is a fundamental assumption
of the test. The test would reject reliable forecasts with probability much
higher than the test size.
