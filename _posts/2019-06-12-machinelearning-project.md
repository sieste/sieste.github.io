title: Can machine learning methods predict chaos? (M-level project)
category: mlevel-project
---

In a series of recently published results, it was claimed
that "model-free" machine learning methods can provide better
predictions of chaotic dynamical systems than the underlying
physical law of the system itself. In this project, the
student will study these claims in detail, with the aim of
replicating the original results, and critically reflecting
on them. The student will gain an understanding of modern
machine learning methods, as well as simulation and
prediction of spatiotemporal chaotic systems.
