title: Radar nowcasting for UK rainfall (M-level project)
category: mlevel-project
---

The UK Met Office data portal publishes 500x500 pixel radar
images of precipitation intensity across the UK, updated in
15-minute intervals. The spatial distribution of rainfall
patterns, and their evolution in time, can be used to
skilfully predict rainfall a few hours ahead. This
data-driven approach to short-term forecasting is called
radar nowcasting. This project will develop and implement
statistcal learning techniques for radar nowcasting across
the UK. The student will gain expertise in modern statistical
modelling methods for large spatio-temporal data sets, as
well as the computational tools to implement these methods
efficiently. A potential application of this project is a
real-time web service that issues routine short-term rain
predictions at locations across the UK.
