**Abstract**

We compile knowledge on limitations to prediction of the time evolution of
complex systems. Although such systems are typically highly chaotic, the
inverse of the maximal Lyapunov exponent, the Lyapunov time, is not the time
scale beyond which predictions fail. Instead, as the example of weather
forecasting will show, predictions can be successful on lead times which are
several orders of magnitude longer. We analyze the reasons which prevent errors
from growing exponentially fast with a rate related to the maximal Lyapunov
exponent. Moreover, we advocate that standard practices from weather
forecasting should be transferred to other fields of complex systemsâ€™
predictions, which includes a statement about the uncertainty related to the
actual prediction and a performance measure on past predictions so that a
decision maker can assess the potential quality of a forecasting scheme.
