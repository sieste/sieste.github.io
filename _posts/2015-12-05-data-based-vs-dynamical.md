**Abstract**

This chapter considers extreme events as short‐lived large deviations from a
system's normal state. It compares the probabilistic predictions of extreme
temperature anomalies issued by two different forecast schemes. One is a
dynamical physical weather model, and the other is a simple data model. These
two types of predictions are evaluated by proper skill scores and receiver
operating characteristic (ROC) analysis, respectively. The chapter considers
events as being extreme whenever they are in the uppermost or lowermost range
of values for a given quantity. It discusses below extreme temperature
anomalies, that is, large deviations of the surface temperature from its
climatological average for the corresponding day of the year, which are to a
good approximation Gaussian distributed. The chapter considers the performance
of predictors for the temperature anomaly to overcome a given threshold on the
following day for all possible threshold values. The target is the prediction
of weather extremes.
