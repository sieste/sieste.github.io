**Abstract**

This study considers the application of the Ignorance Score (IS, also known as
the Logarithmic Score) for ensemble verification. In particular, we consider
the case where an ensemble forecast is transformed to a normal forecast
distribution, and this distribution is evaluated by the IS. It is shown that
the IS systematically depends on the ensemble size, such that larger ensembles
yield better expected scores. An ensemble‐adjusted IS is proposed, which
extrapolates the score of an m‐member ensemble to the score that the ensemble
would achieve if it had fewer or more than m members. Using the ensemble
adjustment, a fair version of the IS is derived, which is optimized if
ensembles are statistically consistent with the observations. The benefit of
the ensemble adjustment is illustrated by comparing ISs of ensembles of
different sizes in a seasonal climate forecasting context and a medium‐range
weather forecasting context. An ensemble‐adjusted score can be used for a fair
comparison between ensembles of different sizes, and to accurately estimate the
expected score of a large operational ensemble by running a much smaller
hindcast ensemble.
