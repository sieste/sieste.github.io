**Abstract**

The decomposition of the Brier score into Reliability, Resolution and
Uncertainty has become a standard method in forecast verification. In this note
a very simple derivation of the familiar Brier score decomposition is
presented. The Reliability and Resolution terms can be calculated as average
Brier score differences between the issued forecast, the recalibrated forecast
and the climatological reference forecast. The result suggests a simple way to
calculate similar decompositions for arbitrary verification scores, and that
recalibration methods and reference forecasts can be chosen more flexibly than
is generally appreciated. A new decomposition of the continuous ranked
probability score (CRPS) is proposed.
