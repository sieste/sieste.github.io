Computer models of atmosphere and ocean physics used for weather and climate
prediction are only imperfect representations of the real world.

As part of my research I develop statistical modelling techniques to correct
systematic forecast errors in computer simulations, in order to improve the
skill and reliability of weather and climate forecasts.
