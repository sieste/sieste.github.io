title: Time series analysis of air quality in Exeter (M-level project)
category: mlevel-project
---

This project will carry out a detailed analysis of time
series data of various air pollutants measured at monitoring
sites across Exeter. The goal of the project is to gain a
detailed understanding of how air quality in Exeter changes
on daily, weekly, and seasonal time scales, and about the
influence of weather patterns and traffic volume. The student
will learn to apply state-of-the-art time series modelling
techniques based on latent Gaussian process models, and study
computationally efficient methods to fitting these models to
large data sets. There is substantial interest in the result
of these analyses from the Exeter city council, health
services, as well as the general public.
