<h2>My highlights from "Zen and the art of motorcycle maintenance"</h2>

<h3>Part 1</h3>

<p>What is in mind is a sort of Chautauqua -- that's the only name I can think of fot it -- like the travelling tent-show Chautauquas that used to move across America, this America, the one that we are now in, an old-time series of popular talks intended to edify and entertain, improve the mind and bring culture and enlightnement to the ears and thoughts of the hearer. [p7]


<p>I would like instead to be concerned with the questin "What is best?," a question which cuts deeply rather than broadly, ... [p8]

<p>The ideas began with what seemed to be a minor difference of opinion between John and me on a matter of small importance: how much one should maintain one's own motorcycle. It seems natural and normal to me to make use of the small tool kits and instruction booklets supplied with each machine, and keep it tuned and adjusted myself. John demurs. He prefers to let a competent mechanic take care of these things so that they are done right. [p10]

<p>It's not the motorcycle maintenance, not the faucet. It's all of technology they can't take. Then all sorts of things started tumbling into place and I knew that was it. [p15]


<p>I argued that phyical discomfort is important only when the mood is wrong. Then you fasten on to whatever thing is uncomfortable and call that the cause. But if the mood is right, then physical discomfort doesn't mean much. [p19]

<p>Caring about what you are doing is considered either unimportant or taken for granted. On this trip I think we should notice it, explore it a little, to see if in that strange separation of what man is from what man does we may have some clues as to what the hell has gone wrong in this twentieth century. I don't want to hurry it. That itself is a poisonous twentieth-century attitude. When you want to hurry something, that means you no longer care about it and want to get on to other things. I just want to get at it slowly, but carefully and thoroughly, with the same attitude I remember was present just before I found that sheared pin. It was that attitude that found it, nothing else. [p27]

<p>After a while he says "Do you believe in ghosts?" "No," I say. "Why not?" "Because they are un-sci-en-ti-fic." The way I say this makes John smile. "They contain no matter," I continue, "and have no energy and therefore, according to the laws of science, do not exist except in people's minds." The whiskey, the fatigue and the wind in the trees start mixing in my mind. "Of course,", I add, " the laws of science contain no matter and have no energy either and therefore do not exist except in people's minds. It's best to be completely scientific about the whole thing and refuse to believe in either ghosts or the laws of science. That way you're safe. That doesn't leave you every much to believe in but that's scientific, too." "I don't know what you're talking about, " Chris says. [p31]


<p>"And what that means," I say before he can interrupt, "and what that means is that that law of gravity exists nowhere except in people's heads! It's a ghost! We are all of us very arrogant and conceited about running down other people's ghosts but just as ignorant and barbaric and superstitious about our own." [p33]

<p>There's kind of a glaring inconsistency here, that's almost too obvious to dwell on. If they can't stand physical discomfort and they can't stand technology, they've got a little compromising to do. ... This condemnation of technology is ingratitude that's what it is. Blind alley, though. If someone's ungrateful and you tell him he's ungrateful, okay, you've called him a name. You haven't solved anything. [p44]


<p>After a while he says, "This is the hardest stuff in the world to photograph. You need a three-hundred-and-sixty-degree lens, or somehting. You see it, and then you look down in the ground glass and it's just nothing. As soon as you put a border on it, it's gone." [p46]

<p>All of us go in a shop for coffee and rolls. Everything is different except one another, so we look around rather than talk, catching fragments of conversation among people who seem to know each other and are glancing at us becaurse we're new. [48]

<p>That's the dimension he's in. The groovy dimension. ... Now it's become aparent that this dimension isn't a fad that's going to go away next year or the year after. It's here to stay because it's a very serious and important way of looking at things that looks imcompatible with reason and order and responsibility but actually is not. Now we are down to the root of things. [p53]

<p>And in the fog there appears an intimation of a figure. It disappears when I look at it directly, but then reappears in the corner of my vision when I turn my glance. I am about to say something, to call to it, to recognize it, but then do not, knowing that to recognize it by any gesture or action is to give it a reality which it must not have. But it is a figure I recognize even though I do not let on. It is Phaedrus. Evil spirit. Insane. From a world without life or death. The figure fades and I hold panic down ... tight ... not rushing it ... just letting it sink in ... not believing it, not disbelieving it ... but the hair crawls slowly on the back of my skull ... he is calling Chris, is that it? ... Yes? ... [p62]

<p>He watches carefully as I take up the rear axle nut until it's barely snug, tap it sideways with a hammer until the chain slack is right, then tighten up the axle nut with all my might to keep the axle from slipping forward later on, and replace the cotter pin. Unlike the axle nuts on a car, this one doesn't affect bearing tightness. "How did you know how to do that?" he asks. "You just have to figure it out." "I wouldn't know where to start," he says. It think to myself, That's the problem, all right, where to start. [p64]

<p>The world of underlying form is an unusual object of discussion because it is actually a mode of discussion itself. You discuss things in terms of their immediate appearance or you discuss them in terms of their undelrying form, and when you try to discuss these modes of discussion you get involved in what could be called a platform problem. You have no platform from which to discuss them other than the modes themselves. [p65]

<p>His kind of rationality has been used since antiquity to remove oneself from the tedium and depression of one's immediate surroundings. What makes it hard to see is that where once it was used to get away from it all, the escape has been so successful that now it is the "it all" that the romantics are trying to escape. What makes his world so hard to see clearly is not its strangeness but its usualness. Familiarity can blind you too. His way of looking at things produces a kind of description that can be called an "analytic" description. That is another name of th e classic platform from which one discusses things in terms of their underlying form. He was a totally classic person. And to give a fuller desciption of what this is I want now to turn his analytic approach back upon itself -- to analyze analysis itself. [p69]

<p>The fourth is that there is a knife moving here. A very deadly one; an intellectual scalpel so swift and so sharp you sometimes don't see it moving. You get the illusion that all those parts are just there and are being named as they exist. But they can be named quite differently and organized quite differently depending on how the knife moves. ... Later I will want to show how an ability to use this knife creatively and effectively can result in solutions to the classic and romantic split. Phaedrus was a master with his knife and used it with dexterity and a sense of power. [p72]


<p>To understand what he was trying to do it's necessary to see that part of the landscape, inseparable from it, which must be understood, is a figure in the middle of it, sorting sand into piles. To see the landscape without seeing this figure is not to see the landscape at all. [p76]

<p> I told Chris the other night that Phaedrus spent his entirre life pursuing a ghost. That was true. The ghost he pursued was the ghost that underlies all of thehnology, all of modern science, all of Western thought. It was the ghost of rationality itself. I told Chris that he found the ghost and that when he found it he thrahsed it good. [p78]

<p>He was sytematic, but to say he ghought and acted like a machine would be to misunderstand the nature of his thought. It was not like pistons and wheels and gears all moving at once, massive and coordinated. The image of a laser beam comes to mind instead; a single pencil of light of such terrific energy in such extreme concentration it can be shot at the moon and its reflection seen back on earth. Phaedrus did not try to use his brilliance for general illumniation. He sought one specific distant target and aimed for it and hit it. Ant that was all. General illumniation of that target he hit now seems to be left for me. [p80]

<p>But who was the old personality whom they had known and presumed I was a continuation of? This was my fisrt inkling of the existence of Phaedrus, many years ago. In the days and weeks and years that have followed, I've learned much more. He was dead. Destroyed by order of the court, enforced by the transmission of high-voltage alternating current through the lobes of his brain. Approximately 800 mills of amperage at durations of 0.5 to 1.5 seconds had been applied on twenty-eight consecutive occasions, in a process known technologically as "Annihilation ECS." A whole personality had been liquidated without a trace in a technologically faultless act that has defined our relationship ever since. I have never met him. Never will. [p84]
