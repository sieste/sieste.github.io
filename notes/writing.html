Writing is a lot about managing expectations &mdash; Place all information where the reader expects them. 
Whose story is being told? Make this the subject, and keep it consistent throughout a paragraph.
What is the action of the subject? Make this the verb, and make it expressive and powerful.
Keep subject and verb close together.
The beginning of a sentence provides backward context and outlook (the Topic Position, "First things first."). 
The end of a sentence provides novelty and closure (the Stress Position, "Save the best for last.").
