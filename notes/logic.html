<h2 id="a-list-of-important-concepts-in-formal-logic">A list of
important concepts in formal logic</h2>
<ol type="1">
<li>Modus Ponens:
<ul>
<li>Definition: A form of argument that if a conditional statement (“if
P then Q”) is accepted, and the antecedent (P) holds, then the
consequent (Q) must also hold.</li>
<li>Example: If it rains, the ground will be wet. It is raining.
Therefore, the ground is wet.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Modus Tollens:
<ul>
<li>Definition: A form of argument that if a conditional statement (“if
P then Q”) is accepted, and the consequent (Q) does not hold, then the
antecedent (P) must also not hold.</li>
<li>Example: If it is a dog, it has four legs. This animal does not have
four legs. Therefore, this animal is not a dog.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Affirming the Consequent:
<ul>
<li>Definition: A logical fallacy where a conditional statement is
incorrectly used by affirming the consequent rather than the
antecedent.</li>
<li>Example: If it is a cat, it has four legs. This animal has four
legs. Therefore, this animal is a cat. (Fallacious because there are
other four-legged animals.)</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Denying the Antecedent:
<ul>
<li>Definition: A logical fallacy where a conditional statement is
incorrectly used by denying the antecedent.</li>
<li>Example: If it’s a bird, it can fly. This animal is not a bird.
Therefore, it cannot fly. (Fallacious because there are other animals
that can fly.)</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Syllogism:
<ul>
<li>Definition: A form of reasoning in which a conclusion is drawn from
two given or assumed propositions (premises).</li>
<li>Example: All men are mortal. Socrates is a man. Therefore, Socrates
is mortal.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Categorical Syllogism:
<ul>
<li>Definition: A syllogism where each statement is a categorical
proposition (e.g., All A are B, Some B are C).</li>
<li>Example: All mammals are warm-blooded. All whales are mammals.
Therefore, all whales are warm-blooded.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Hypothetical Syllogism:
<ul>
<li>Definition: A syllogism having a conditional statement for one or
both of its premises.</li>
<li>Example: If it rains, the ground gets wet. If the ground gets wet,
the plants grow. Therefore, if it rains, the plants grow.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Disjunctive Syllogism:
<ul>
<li>Definition: A syllogism using a disjunctive (“either/or”)
proposition.</li>
<li>Example: Either the battery is dead or the bulb is burnt out. The
battery is not dead. Therefore, the bulb is burnt out.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Law of Excluded Middle:
<ul>
<li>Definition: A principle stating that for any proposition, either
that proposition is true, or its negation is true.</li>
<li>Example: Either it will rain tomorrow, or it will not rain
tomorrow.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Law of Non-Contradiction:
<ul>
<li>Definition: A principle that a statement and its negation cannot
both be true at the same time.</li>
<li>Example: It cannot be both raining and not raining at the same time
and in the same place.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Law of Identity:
<ul>
<li>Definition: A principle stating that every object is identical with
itself; essentially, “A is A.”</li>
<li>Example: If something is a cat, then it is a cat.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Conditional Statement:
<ul>
<li>Definition: A statement of the “if-then” form, expressing a
hypothesis and a conclusion.</li>
<li>Example: If it is raining (hypothesis), then the ground is wet
(conclusion).</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Biconditional Statement:
<ul>
<li>Definition: A statement where both the conditional and its converse
are true; expressed as “P if and only if Q.”</li>
<li>Example: A figure is a square if and only if it is a rectangle with
equal sides.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Fallacy of Composition:
<ul>
<li>Definition: Assuming that what is true of a part is true for the
whole.</li>
<li>Example: Each brick in this wall is light; therefore, the wall is
light. (Fallacious as the collective weight can be substantial.)</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Fallacy of Division:
<ul>
<li>Definition: Assuming that what is true of the whole is true for the
parts.</li>
<li>Example: That machine is heavy, so every part of it is heavy.
(Fallacious as individual components may be light.)</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Argumentum ad Hominem:
<ul>
<li>Definition: A fallacy where an argument is rebutted by attacking the
character, motive, or other attribute of the person making the argument,
rather than addressing the substance of the argument itself.</li>
<li>Example: You can’t believe John’s argument on climate change because
he failed high school science.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Straw Man Fallacy:
<ul>
<li>Definition: Misrepresenting someone’s argument to make it easier to
attack.</li>
<li>Example: Person A: We should improve public healthcare. Person B:
Person A believes we should put all our resources into health care and
ignore all other important issues.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Red Herring Fallacy:
<ul>
<li>Definition: Introducing an irrelevant topic to divert the argument
from the actual issue.</li>
<li>Example: In a debate about environmental policy, one speaker might
divert to the economy, which, while related, doesn’t address the
environmental issues directly.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Circular Reasoning:
<ul>
<li>Definition: An argument that commits the logical fallacy of assuming
what it is attempting to prove.</li>
<li>Example: “The Bible is true because it’s the word of God. We know
it’s the word of God because the Bible says so.”</li>
</ul></li>
<li>False Dilemma:
<ul>
<li>Definition: A fallacy in which an argument presents two options and
ignores, either purposefully or out of ignorance, other
alternatives.</li>
<li>Example: You’re either with us, or you’re against us.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Inductive Reasoning:
<ul>
<li>Definition: A type of reasoning that involves making generalizations
based on specific observations or instances.</li>
<li>Example: Every cat I have seen has four legs; therefore, all cats
must have four legs.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Deductive Reasoning:
<ul>
<li>Definition: A type of reasoning that moves from general premises to
a specific conclusion.</li>
<li>Example: All birds lay eggs. A swan is a bird. Therefore, swans lay
eggs.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Abductive Reasoning:
<ul>
<li>Definition: A form of reasoning which starts with an observation or
set of observations and then seeks to find the simplest and most likely
explanation.</li>
<li>Example: The lawn is wet. The simplest and most likely explanation
is that it rained.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Post hoc ergo propter hoc:
<ul>
<li>Definition: A logical fallacy that states “since event Y followed
event X, event Y must have been caused by event X.”</li>
<li>Example: It rained after we danced the rain dance; therefore, the
rain dance caused the rain.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Slippery Slope:
<ul>
<li>Definition: A fallacy in which a relatively small first step is
assumed to lead to a chain of related events culminating in some
significant effect.</li>
<li>Example: If we allow students to redo this test, they will expect to
redo every test, leading to a complete breakdown of academic
standards.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Appeal to Authority:
<ul>
<li>Definition: A fallacy in which an argument is based on unsound
appeal to authority.</li>
<li>Example: My doctor says this medicine works, so it must be the best
choice. (Fallacious if the doctor is not a specialist in that particular
field of medicine.)</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Appeal to Tradition:
<ul>
<li>Definition: A fallacy where something is accepted as true or better
because it’s the “way it’s always been done.”</li>
<li>Example: We should continue to use this software because we’ve
always used it.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Begging the Question:
<ul>
<li>Definition: A logical fallacy in which the writer or speaker assumes
the statement under examination to be true.</li>
<li>Example: Paranormal activity is real because I have experienced what
can only be described as paranormal activity.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Hasty Generalization:
<ul>
<li>Definition: Making a rushed conclusion without considering all of
the variables.</li>
<li>Example: My father smoked four packs of cigarettes a day and lived
until age 90, so smoking probably isn’t that bad for you.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>False Equivalence:
<ul>
<li>Definition: A fallacy in which two opposing arguments appear to be
logically equivalent when in fact they are not.</li>
<li>Example: Claiming that a surgeon cutting into a patient to perform
surgery is the same as an assault with a knife.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Equivalence:
<ul>
<li>Definition: The relationship between two statements that are either
both true or both false.</li>
<li>Example: “The ball is red” is equivalent to “The color of the ball
is red.”</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Contradiction:
<ul>
<li>Definition: A logical inconsistency between two or more
propositions, where if one is true, the others must be false.</li>
<li>Example: “It is raining” and “It is not raining” are in
contradiction.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Tautology:
<ul>
<li>Definition: A statement that is true by necessity or by virtue of
its logical form.</li>
<li>Example: “It will either rain tomorrow, or it will not rain
tomorrow” is a tautology.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Logical Consequence:
<ul>
<li>Definition: A relationship between statements that holds true when
if the first statement is true, the second statement must be true.</li>
<li>Example: If “All humans are mortal” and “Socrates is a human,” then
it logically follows that “Socrates is mortal.”</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Soundness:
<ul>
<li>Definition: A property of a deductive argument when it is both valid
(the conclusion logically follows from the premises) and the premises
are true.</li>
<li>Example: “All mammals breathe. Whales are mammals. Therefore, whales
breathe.” This argument is sound because its premises are true and the
conclusion logically follows.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Validity:
<ul>
<li>Definition: A feature of a deductive argument that is structured in
such a way that if the premises are true, the conclusion must be
true.</li>
<li>Example: “All birds can fly. Penguins are birds. Therefore, penguins
can fly.” This argument is valid in structure, but not sound because one
premise is false (not all birds can fly).</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Non Sequitur:
<ul>
<li>Definition: A fallacy in which a conclusion does not follow
logically from what preceded it.</li>
<li>Example: “She’s wearing red shoes. She must be a fun person.”</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Ad Populum (Bandwagon Fallacy):
<ul>
<li>Definition: A fallacy that occurs when something is considered true
or good solely because it is popular.</li>
<li>Example: “Everyone I know uses this brand of phone, so it must be
the best.”</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Appeal to Ignorance (Argumentum ad Ignorantiam):
<ul>
<li>Definition: A fallacy that occurs when it is assumed that a claim is
true because it has not been proven false or vice versa.</li>
<li>Example: “There’s no evidence that ghosts don’t exist, therefore
they must exist.”</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Loaded Question:
<ul>
<li>Definition: Asking a question that contains an assumption within it,
which can corner the respondent into appearing guilty.</li>
<li>Example: “Have you stopped taking illegal substances?” This implies
the person was taking illegal substances previously.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Argument from Analogy:
<ul>
<li>Definition: Making a comparison between two similar cases and
inferring that what is true for one is also true for the other.</li>
<li>Example: “Just as a gardener nurtures and grows plants, a teacher
shapes and develops students.”</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Sufficient and Necessary Conditions:
<ul>
<li>Definition: A necessary condition is something that must be true for
the statement to be true. A sufficient condition is one that, if true,
guarantees the truth of the statement.</li>
<li>Example: Being a bachelor is a necessary condition for being an
unmarried man. Being an unmarried man is a sufficient condition for
being a bachelor.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Argumentum ad Misericordiam (Appeal to Pity):
<ul>
<li>Definition: A fallacy in which someone tries to win support for an
argument by exploiting his or her opponent’s feelings of pity or
guilt.</li>
<li>Example: “You should give me a higher grade on this paper because I
was sick the week before it was due.”</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Tu Quoque:
<ul>
<li>Definition: A fallacy that attempts to discredit an opponent’s
position by asserting the opponent’s failure to act consistently with
that position.</li>
<li>Example: “You say smoking is bad for health, but you smoke
too.”</li>
</ul></li>
<li>No True Scotsman:
<ul>
<li>Definition: A way of reinterpreting evidence in order to prevent the
refutation of one’s position.</li>
<li>Example: “No true vegan would ever eat meat.” When shown a vegan who
eats meat, the claimant might respond, “Well, no true vegan would do
that.”</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Cherry Picking (Selective Evidence):
<ul>
<li>Definition: Focusing only on evidence that supports your argument
while ignoring any evidence that contradicts it.</li>
<li>Example: A politician highlighting only the statistics that support
his policies, while ignoring those that contradict them.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>False Cause (Post Hoc Ergo Propter Hoc):
<ul>
<li>Definition: Assuming that because two events occurred in succession,
the former event caused the latter event.</li>
<li>Example: “After the new mayor took office, crime rates fell.
Therefore, the new mayor caused the decrease in crime.”</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Middle Ground (False Compromise):
<ul>
<li>Definition: Assuming that the compromise between two positions is
always correct.</li>
<li>Example: “Some people say climate change is a severe threat, others
say it’s a hoax. The truth must be somewhere in the middle.”</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Slanting:
<ul>
<li>Definition: Selecting facts or words with connotations that favor
the arguer’s bias.</li>
<li>Example: Describing a political opponent as “a no-good extremist”
instead of simply stating their position.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Composition/Decomposition:
<ul>
<li>Definition: Breaking down complex arguments or statements into
smaller parts to understand their structure and meaning.</li>
<li>Example: Analyzing a philosophical text by examining its individual
arguments and how they contribute to the overall thesis.</li>
</ul></li>
