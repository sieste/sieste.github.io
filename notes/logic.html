concepts in logic</h2>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Modus Ponens:</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Definition:</strong> A form of argument that if a
conditional statement (“if P then Q”) is accepted, and the antecedent
(P) holds, then the consequent (Q) must also hold.</li>
<li><strong>Example:</strong> If it rains, the ground will be wet. It is
raining. Therefore, the ground is wet.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Modus Tollens:</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Definition:</strong> A form of argument that if a
conditional statement (“if P then Q”) is accepted, and the consequent
(Q) does not hold, then the antecedent (P) must also not hold.</li>
<li><strong>Example:</strong> If it is a dog, it has four legs. This
animal does not have four legs. Therefore, this animal is not a
dog.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Affirming the Consequent:</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Definition:</strong> A logical fallacy where a conditional
statement is incorrectly used by affirming the consequent rather than
the antecedent.</li>
<li><strong>Example:</strong> If it is a cat, it has four legs. This
animal has four legs. Therefore, this animal is a cat. (Fallacious
because there are other four-legged animals.)</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Denying the Antecedent:</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Definition:</strong> A logical fallacy where a conditional
statement is incorrectly used by denying the antecedent.</li>
<li><strong>Example:</strong> If it’s a bird, it can fly. This animal is
not a bird. Therefore, it cannot fly. (Fallacious because there are
other animals that can fly.)</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Syllogism:</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Definition:</strong> A form of reasoning in which a
conclusion is drawn from two given or assumed propositions
(premises).</li>
<li><strong>Example:</strong> All men are mortal. Socrates is a man.
Therefore, Socrates is mortal.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Categorical Syllogism:</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Definition:</strong> A syllogism where each statement is a
categorical proposition (e.g., All A are B, Some B are C).</li>
<li><strong>Example:</strong> All mammals are warm-blooded. All whales
are mammals. Therefore, all whales are warm-blooded.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Hypothetical Syllogism:</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Definition:</strong> A syllogism having a conditional
statement for one or both of its premises.</li>
<li><strong>Example:</strong> If it rains, the ground gets wet. If the
ground gets wet, the plants grow. Therefore, if it rains, the plants
grow.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Disjunctive Syllogism:</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Definition:</strong> A syllogism using a disjunctive
(“either/or”) proposition.</li>
<li><strong>Example:</strong> Either the battery is dead or the bulb is
burnt out. The battery is not dead. Therefore, the bulb is burnt
out.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Law of Excluded Middle:</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Definition:</strong> A principle stating that for any
proposition, either that proposition is true, or its negation is
true.</li>
<li><strong>Example:</strong> Either it will rain tomorrow, or it will
not rain tomorrow.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Law of Non-Contradiction:</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Definition:</strong> A principle that a statement and its
negation cannot both be true at the same time.</li>
<li><strong>Example:</strong> It cannot be both raining and not raining
at the same time and in the same place.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Law of Identity:</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Definition:</strong> A principle stating that every object
is identical with itself; essentially, “A is A.”</li>
<li><strong>Example:</strong> If something is a cat, then it is a
cat.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Conditional Statement:</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Definition:</strong> A statement of the “if-then” form,
expressing a hypothesis and a conclusion.</li>
<li><strong>Example:</strong> If it is raining (hypothesis), then the
ground is wet (conclusion).</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Biconditional Statement:</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Definition:</strong> A statement where both the conditional
and its converse are true; expressed as “P if and only if Q.”</li>
<li><strong>Example:</strong> A figure is a square if and only if it is
a rectangle with equal sides.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Fallacy of Composition:</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Definition:</strong> Assuming that what is true of a part is
true for the whole.</li>
<li><strong>Example:</strong> Each brick in this wall is light;
therefore, the wall is light. (Fallacious as the collective weight can
be substantial.)</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Fallacy of Division:</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Definition:</strong> Assuming that what is true of the whole
is true for the parts.</li>
<li><strong>Example:</strong> That machine is heavy, so every part of it
is heavy. (Fallacious as individual components may be light.)</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Argumentum ad Hominem:</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Definition:</strong> A fallacy where an argument is rebutted
by attacking the character, motive, or other attribute of the person
making the argument, rather than addressing the substance of the
argument itself.</li>
<li><strong>Example:</strong> You can’t believe John’s argument on
climate change because he failed high school science.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Straw Man Fallacy:</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Definition:</strong> Misrepresenting someone’s argument to
make it easier to attack.</li>
<li><strong>Example:</strong> Person A: We should improve public
healthcare. Person B: Person A believes we should put all our resources
into health care and ignore all other important issues.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Red Herring Fallacy:</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Definition:</strong> Introducing an irrelevant topic to
divert the argument from the actual issue.</li>
<li><strong>Example:</strong> In a debate about environmental policy,
one speaker might divert to the economy, which, while related, doesn’t
address the environmental issues directly.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Circular Reasoning:</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Definition:</strong> An argument that commits the logical
fallacy of assuming what it is attempting to prove.</li>
<li><strong>Example:</strong> “The Bible is true because it’s the word
of God. We know it’s the word of God because the Bible says so.”</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>False Dilemma:</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Definition:</strong> A fallacy in which an argument presents
two options and ignores, either purposefully or out of ignorance, other
alternatives.</li>
<li><strong>Example:</strong> You’re either with us, or you’re against
us.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Inductive Reasoning:</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Definition:</strong> A type of reasoning that involves
making generalizations based on specific observations or instances.</li>
<li><strong>Example:</strong> Every cat I have seen has four legs;
therefore, all cats must have four legs.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Deductive Reasoning:</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Definition:</strong> A type of reasoning that moves from
general premises to a specific conclusion.</li>
<li><strong>Example:</strong> All birds lay eggs. A swan is a bird.
Therefore, swans lay eggs.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Abductive Reasoning:</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Definition:</strong> A form of reasoning which starts with
an observation or set of observations and then seeks to find the
simplest and most likely explanation.</li>
<li><strong>Example:</strong> The lawn is wet. The simplest and most
likely explanation is that it rained.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Post hoc ergo propter hoc:</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Definition:</strong> A logical fallacy that states “since
event Y followed event X, event Y must have been caused by event
X.”</li>
<li><strong>Example:</strong> It rained after we danced the rain dance;
therefore, the rain dance caused the rain.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Slippery Slope:</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Definition:</strong> A fallacy in which a relatively small
first step is assumed to lead to a chain of related events culminating
in some significant effect.</li>
<li><strong>Example:</strong> If we allow students to redo this test,
they will expect to redo every test, leading to a complete breakdown of
academic standards.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Appeal to Authority:</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Definition:</strong> A fallacy in which an argument is based
on unsound appeal to authority.</li>
<li><strong>Example:</strong> My doctor says this medicine works, so it
must be the best choice. (Fallacious if the doctor is not a specialist
in that particular field of medicine.)</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Appeal to Tradition:</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Definition:</strong> A fallacy where something is accepted
as true or better because it’s the “way it’s always been done.”</li>
<li><strong>Example:</strong> We should continue to use this software
because we’ve always used it.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Begging the Question:</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Definition:</strong> A logical fallacy in which the writer
or speaker assumes the statement under examination to be true.</li>
<li><strong>Example:</strong> Paranormal activity is real because I have
experienced what can only be described as paranormal activity.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Hasty Generalization:</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Definition:</strong> Making a rushed conclusion without
considering all of the variables.</li>
<li><strong>Example:</strong> My father smoked four packs of cigarettes
a day and lived until age 90, so smoking probably isn’t that bad for
you.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>False Equivalence:</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Definition:</strong> A fallacy in which two opposing
arguments appear to be logically equivalent when in fact they are
not.</li>
<li><strong>Example:</strong> Claiming that a surgeon cutting into a
patient to perform surgery is the same as an assault with a knife.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Equivalence:</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Definition:</strong> The relationship between two statements
that are either both true or both false.</li>
<li><strong>Example:</strong> “The ball is red” is equivalent to “The
color of the ball is red.”</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Contradiction:</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Definition:</strong> A logical inconsistency between two or
more propositions, where if one is true, the others must be false.</li>
<li><strong>Example:</strong> “It is raining” and “It is not raining”
are in contradiction.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Tautology:</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Definition:</strong> A statement that is true by necessity
or by virtue of its logical form.</li>
<li><strong>Example:</strong> “It will either rain tomorrow, or it will
not rain tomorrow” is a tautology.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Logical Consequence:</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Definition:</strong> A relationship between statements that
holds true when if the first statement is true, the second statement
must be true.</li>
<li><strong>Example:</strong> If “All humans are mortal” and “Socrates
is a human,” then it logically follows that “Socrates is mortal.”</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Soundness:</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Definition:</strong> A property of a deductive argument when
it is both valid (the conclusion logically follows from the premises)
and the premises are true.</li>
<li><strong>Example:</strong> “All mammals breathe. Whales are mammals.
Therefore, whales breathe.” This argument is sound because its premises
are true and the conclusion logically follows.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Validity:</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Definition:</strong> A feature of a deductive argument that
is structured in such a way that if the premises are true, the
conclusion must be true.</li>
<li><strong>Example:</strong> “All birds can fly. Penguins are birds.
Therefore, penguins can fly.” This argument is valid in structure, but
not sound because one premise is false (not all birds can fly).</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Non Sequitur:</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Definition:</strong> A fallacy in which a conclusion does
not follow logically from what preceded it.</li>
<li><strong>Example:</strong> “She’s wearing red shoes. She must be a
fun person.”</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Ad Populum (Bandwagon Fallacy):</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Definition:</strong> A fallacy that occurs when something is
considered true or good solely because it is popular.</li>
<li><strong>Example:</strong> “Everyone I know uses this brand of phone,
so it must be the best.”</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Appeal to Ignorance (Argumentum ad Ignorantiam):</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Definition:</strong> A fallacy that occurs when it is
assumed that a claim is true because it has not been proven false or
vice versa.</li>
<li><strong>Example:</strong> “There’s no evidence that ghosts don’t
exist, therefore they must exist.”</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Loaded Question:</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Definition:</strong> Asking a question that contains an
assumption within it, which can corner the respondent into appearing
guilty.</li>
<li><strong>Example:</strong> “Have you stopped taking illegal
substances?” This implies the person was taking illegal substances
previously.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Argument from Analogy:</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Definition:</strong> Making a comparison between two similar
cases and inferring that what is true for one is also true for the
other.</li>
<li><strong>Example:</strong> “Just as a gardener nurtures and grows
plants, a teacher shapes and develops students.”</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Sufficient and Necessary Conditions:</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Definition:</strong> A necessary condition is something that
must be true for the statement to be true. A sufficient condition is one
that, if true, guarantees the truth of the statement.</li>
<li><strong>Example:</strong> Being a bachelor is a necessary condition
for being an unmarried man. Being an unmarried man is a sufficient
condition for being a bachelor.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Argumentum ad Misericordiam (Appeal to Pity):</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Definition:</strong> A fallacy in which someone tries to win
support for an argument by exploiting his or her opponent’s feelings of
pity or guilt.</li>
<li><strong>Example:</strong> “You should give me a higher grade on this
paper because I was sick the week before it was due.”</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Tu Quoque:</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Definition:</strong> A fallacy that attempts to discredit an
opponent’s position by asserting the opponent’s failure to act
consistently with that position.</li>
<li><strong>Example:</strong> “You say smoking is bad for health, but
you smoke too.”</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>No True Scotsman:</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Definition:</strong> A way of reinterpreting evidence in
order to prevent the refutation of one’s position.</li>
<li><strong>Example:</strong> “No true vegan would ever eat meat.” When
shown a vegan who eats meat, the claimant might respond, “Well, no true
vegan would do that.”</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Cherry Picking (Selective Evidence):</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Definition:</strong> Focusing only on evidence that supports
your argument while ignoring any evidence that contradicts it.</li>
<li><strong>Example:</strong> A politician highlighting only the
statistics that support his policies, while ignoring those that
contradict them.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>False Cause (Post Hoc Ergo Propter Hoc):</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Definition:</strong> Assuming that because two events
occurred in succession, the former event caused the latter event.</li>
<li><strong>Example:</strong> “After the new mayor took office, crime
rates fell. Therefore, the new mayor caused the decrease in crime.”</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Middle Ground (False Compromise):</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Definition:</strong> Assuming that the compromise between
two positions is always correct.</li>
<li><strong>Example:</strong> “Some people say climate change is a
severe threat, others say it’s a hoax. The truth must be somewhere in
the middle.”</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Slanting:</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Definition:</strong> Selecting facts or words with
connotations that favor the arguer’s bias.</li>
<li><strong>Example:</strong> Describing a political opponent as “a
no-good extremist” instead of simply stating their position.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Composition/Decomposition:</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Definition:</strong> Breaking down complex arguments or
statements into smaller parts to understand their structure and
meaning.</li>
<li><strong>Example:</strong> Analyzing a philosophical text by
examining its individual arguments and how they contribute to the
overall thesis.</li>
</ul></li>
