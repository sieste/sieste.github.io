1. Modus Ponens:
    - Definition: A form of argument that if a conditional statement ("if P then Q") is accepted, and the antecedent (P) holds, then the consequent (Q) must also hold.
    - Example: If it rains, the ground will be wet. It is raining. Therefore, the ground is wet.

1. Modus Tollens:
    - Definition: A form of argument that if a conditional statement ("if P then Q") is accepted, and the consequent (Q) does not hold, then the antecedent (P) must also not hold.
    - Example: If it is a dog, it has four legs. This animal does not have four legs. Therefore, this animal is not a dog.

1. Affirming the Consequent:
    - Definition: A logical fallacy where a conditional statement is incorrectly used by affirming the consequent rather than the antecedent.
    - Example: If it is a cat, it has four legs. This animal has four legs. Therefore, this animal is a cat. (Fallacious because there are other four-legged animals.)

1. Denying the Antecedent:
    - Definition: A logical fallacy where a conditional statement is incorrectly used by denying the antecedent.
    - Example: If it's a bird, it can fly. This animal is not a bird. Therefore, it cannot fly. (Fallacious because there are other animals that can fly.)

1. Syllogism:
    - Definition: A form of reasoning in which a conclusion is drawn from two given or assumed propositions (premises).
    - Example: All men are mortal. Socrates is a man. Therefore, Socrates is mortal.

1. Categorical Syllogism:
    - Definition: A syllogism where each statement is a categorical proposition (e.g., All A are B, Some B are C).
    - Example: All mammals are warm-blooded. All whales are mammals. Therefore, all whales are warm-blooded.

1. Hypothetical Syllogism:
    - Definition: A syllogism having a conditional statement for one or both of its premises.
    - Example: If it rains, the ground gets wet. If the ground gets wet, the plants grow. Therefore, if it rains, the plants grow.

1. Disjunctive Syllogism:
    - Definition: A syllogism using a disjunctive ("either/or") proposition.
    - Example: Either the battery is dead or the bulb is burnt out. The battery is not dead. Therefore, the bulb is burnt out.

1. Law of Excluded Middle:
    - Definition: A principle stating that for any proposition, either that proposition is true, or its negation is true.
    - Example: Either it will rain tomorrow, or it will not rain tomorrow.

1. Law of Non-Contradiction:
    - Definition: A principle that a statement and its negation cannot both be true at the same time.
    - Example: It cannot be both raining and not raining at the same time and in the same place.

1. Law of Identity:
    - Definition: A principle stating that every object is identical with itself; essentially, "A is A."
    - Example: If something is a cat, then it is a cat.

1. Conditional Statement:
    - Definition: A statement of the "if-then" form, expressing a hypothesis and a conclusion.
    - Example: If it is raining (hypothesis), then the ground is wet (conclusion).

1. Biconditional Statement:
    - Definition: A statement where both the conditional and its converse are true; expressed as "P if and only if Q."
    - Example: A figure is a square if and only if it is a rectangle with equal sides.

1. Fallacy of Composition:
    - Definition: Assuming that what is true of a part is true for the whole.
    - Example: Each brick in this wall is light; therefore, the wall is light. (Fallacious as the collective weight can be substantial.)

1. Fallacy of Division:
    - Definition: Assuming that what is true of the whole is true for the parts.
    - Example: That machine is heavy, so every part of it is heavy. (Fallacious as individual components may be light.)

1. Argumentum ad Hominem:
    - Definition: A fallacy where an argument is rebutted by attacking the character, motive, or other attribute of the person making the argument, rather than addressing the substance of the argument itself.
    - Example: You can't believe John's argument on climate change because he failed high school science.

1. Straw Man Fallacy:

    - Example: You're either with us, or you're against us.

1. Inductive Reasoning:
    - Definition: A type of reasoning that involves making generalizations based on specific observations or instances.
    - Example: Every cat I have seen has four legs; therefore, all cats must have four legs.

1. Deductive Reasoning:
    - Definition: A type of reasoning that moves from general premises to a specific conclusion.
    - Example: All birds lay eggs. A swan is a bird. Therefore, swans lay eggs.

1. Abductive Reasoning:
    - Definition: A form of reasoning which starts with an observation or set of observations and then seeks to find the simplest and most likely explanation.
    - Example: The lawn is wet. The simplest and most likely explanation is that it rained.

1. Post hoc ergo propter hoc:
    - Definition: A logical fallacy that states "since event Y followed event X, event Y must have been caused by event X."
    - Example: It rained after we danced the rain dance; therefore, the rain dance caused the rain.

1. Slippery Slope:
    - Definition: A fallacy in which a relatively small first step is assumed to lead to a chain of related events culminating in some significant effect.
    - Example: If we allow students to redo this test, they will expect to redo every test, leading to a complete breakdown of academic standards.

1. Appeal to Authority:
    - Definition: A fallacy in which an argument is based on unsound appeal to authority.

    - Example: Paranormal activity is real because I have experienced what can only be described as paranormal activity.

1. Hasty Generalization:
    - Definition: Making a rushed conclusion without considering all of the variables.
    - Example: My father smoked four packs of cigarettes a day and lived until age 90, so smoking probably isn’t that bad for you.

1. False Equivalence:
    - Definition: A fallacy in which two opposing arguments appear to be logically equivalent when in fact they are not.
    - Example: Claiming that a surgeon cutting into a patient to perform surgery is the same as an assault with a knife.

1. Equivalence:
    - Definition: The relationship between two statements that are either both true or both false.
    - Example: "The ball is red" is equivalent to "The color of the ball is red."

1. Contradiction:
    - Definition: A logical inconsistency between two or more propositions, where if one is true, the others must be false.
    - Example: "It is raining" and "It is not raining" are in contradiction.

1. Tautology:
    - Definition: A statement that is true by necessity or by virtue of its logical form.
    - Example: "It will either rain tomorrow, or it will not rain tomorrow" is a tautology.

1. Logical Consequence:
    - Definition: A relationship between statements that holds true when if the first statement is true, the second statement must be true.
    - Example: If "All humans are mortal" and "Socrates is a human," then it logically follows that "Socrates is mortal."

1. Soundness:
    - Definition: A property of a deductive argument when it is both valid (the conclusion logically follows from the premises) and the premises are true.
    - Example: "All mammals breathe. Whales are mammals. Therefore, whales breathe." This argument is sound because its premises are true and the conclusion logically follows.

1. Validity:
    - Definition: A feature of a deductive argument that is structured in such a way that if the premises are true, the conclusion must be true.
    - Example: "All birds can fly. Penguins are birds. Therefore, penguins can fly." This argument is valid in structure, but not sound because one premise is false (not all birds can fly).

1. Non Sequitur:
    - Definition: A fallacy in which a conclusion does not follow logically from what preceded it.
    - Example: "She's wearing red shoes. She must be a fun person."

1. Ad Populum (Bandwagon Fallacy):
    - Definition: A fallacy that occurs when something is considered true or good solely because it is popular.

1. Appeal to Ignorance (Argumentum ad Ignorantiam):
    - Definition: A fallacy that occurs when it is assumed that a claim is true because it has not been proven false or vice versa.
    - Example: "There's no evidence that ghosts don't exist, therefore they must exist."

1. Loaded Question:
    - Definition: Asking a question that contains an assumption within it, which can corner the respondent into appearing guilty.

1. Argument from Analogy:
    - Definition: Making a comparison between two similar cases and inferring that what is true for one is also true for the other.
    - Example: "Just as a gardener nurtures and grows plants, a teacher shapes and develops students."

1. Sufficient and Necessary Conditions:
    - Definition: A necessary condition is something that must be true for the statement to be true. A sufficient condition is one that, if true, guarantees the truth of the statement.
    - Example: Being a bachelor is a necessary condition for being an unmarried man. Being an unmarried man is a sufficient condition for being a bachelor.

1. Argumentum ad Misericordiam (Appeal to Pity):
    - Definition: A fallacy in which someone tries to win support for an argument by exploiting his or her opponent's feelings of pity or guilt.

1. No True Scotsman:
    - Definition: A way of reinterpreting evidence in order to prevent the refutation of one's position.

1. Cherry Picking (Selective Evidence):
    - Definition: Focusing only on evidence that supports your argument while ignoring any evidence that contradicts it.
    - Example: A politician highlighting only the statistics that support his policies, while ignoring those that contradict them.

1. False Cause (Post Hoc Ergo Propter Hoc):
    - Definition: Assuming that because two events occurred in succession, the former event caused the latter event.
    - Example: "After the new mayor took office, crime rates fell. Therefore, the new mayor caused the decrease in crime."

1. Middle Ground (False Compromise):
    - Definition: Assuming that the compromise between two positions is always correct.
    - Example: "Some people say climate change is a severe threat, others say it's a hoax. The truth must be somewhere in the middle."

1. Slanting:
