Starting point: <a href=https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/models-science/>"Models in Science"</a>

<h3>What do we *mean* by "model"?</h3>

<p>
Semantics (study of meaning) - What do we actually *mean* by "model" and "reality"? 
Semantics is a subfield of <a href=https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/meaning/>Theory of meaning</a>

<p>
Representational models. What does it *mean* for a model to represent the world? <a href=https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/scientific-representation/>Scientific representation</a>

<p>
Types of representational models include: Scale models, analogical models, idealized models, toy models, minimal models, phenomenological models, exploratory models, and models of data. (neither exhaustive nor exclusive)

<p>
<a href=https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/reasoning-analogy/>Analogy and Analogical reasoning</a> Exploit shared properties of, and relationships between, constituents (abstract or concrete) of two things. Billiard ball model of gas, hydraulic model of electricity. Can an abstract analogy be used for Bayesian updating?

<p>
<a href=https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/simulations-science/>Computer Simulations in Science</a>. The analogy between computer model and real world system is an abstract one. How can beliefs about real world be updated based on a computer model simulation?

<p>
<a href=https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/scientific-reduction/>Scientific reduction</a> Idealised models exaggerate and simplify to improve tractability and understandability. Aristotelian idealisations strip away but don't introduce falsities, e.g. planets as point masses. Galilean idealisations introduce deliberate distortions of reality, e.g. rational agents, spherical cows. Approximations relate only to quantitative, mathematical closeness. Pendulum exampls: Period roughly 2 seconds is an approximation, massless string and point mass bob is an idealisation.

<p>
Related: Toy models, minimal models. Highly simplified, distorted. Aren't necessarily representational, but can serve other purposes, such as understanding common behaviors of a larger class of losely related systems (e.g. chaos), studying mathematical methods, initial proof-of-concept for more realistic models. See also "Exploratory models" further down.


<p>
Phenomenological models: Only represent observable properties, without postulating theory or mechanisms. Seems a rather poorly defined category.
<a href=https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/science-theory-observation/>Theory and Observation in Science</a>

<p>
Data models. Removing outliers, and fitting a neat curve, construction partly guided by data, partly by rationalisations and subjective choices. Too sloppy as a description of statistical data models IMO, but provides quite a few references.
<a href=https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/statistics/>Philosophy of Statistics</a>

<h3>What kind of object *is* a "model"?</h3>

<p>
Ontology is the study of "what there is". See also <a href=https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/logic-ontology>Logic and Ontology</a>.

<p>
Physical objects can be models. Cardboard bridges, lab mice, model planes. Don't pose ontological problems beyond how the model is related to the target system.

<p>
Fictional objects. Developing a (conceptual, non-physical) model is akin to inventing a literary character. Use literary fiction as an analogy for models in science. Some specific issues that an ontology of models in terms of fictional entities must address. Can use literature on fiction to study them. Pretense theory of fiction. "The new fiction view of models". But is there even such a thing as a <a href=https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/fictional-entities/>"fictional entity"</a>? 


<p>
<a href=https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/abstract-objects/>Abstract objects</a>. Concrete vs abstract is a fundamental metaphysical categorisation. "Artifactualist view" of models. Like Platonism models *exist* as abstract objects, but contra Platonism, they aren't eternal but created. 

<p>
Set-theoretic structures. No idea what this section is all about.
