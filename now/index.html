<h2>What I'm up to</h2>

<h3>Update 2022-12-07</h3>

<p>Now a proud karate green belt!</p>

<p>The Exeter Maths Society Winter Ball was great fun, thanks for inviting me! I didn't expect what an attraction a lecturer would be at a student party, and with all the selfies and free drinks I felt like a minor celebrity.</p>

<p>Very much enjoyed our traditional Christmas baking at home on the first advent. Plaetzchen und Gluehwein!</p>

<p>Looking forward to spending the Christmas holidays in Germany this year.</p>
