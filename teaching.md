## M-Level projects for 2019/2020

Below are M-Level projects I am offering for the next academic year, for the
modules ECMM705 (30 credits) and MTHM044 (45 credits). Please email me if you
are interested. I am also happy to discuss modifications of these projects, as
well as alternative proposals for projects related to spatio-temporal
statistical modelling, machine learning methodology, and prediction of complex
systems.
